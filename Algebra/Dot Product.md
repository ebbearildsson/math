## Definition
Multiplies [[Vector]]s in such a way to recieve a [[Scalar]]. Done by multiplying each value with the corresponding ones on the other vector and then taking the [[Sum]].
> If the dot product between two vectors is zero they are perpendicular.
## Methods
$$\begin{gather}
v_{1}:(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})\\
v_{2}:(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})\\
v_{1}\cdot v_{2}=x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+z_{1}z_{2}
\end{gather}$$
