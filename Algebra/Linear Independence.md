## Definition
For the [[Set]] of [[Vectors]], $V = v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$, there exists no combination such that $a_1v_1+a_2v_2+...+a_nv_n=0$. Where at least one of the [[Scalar]]s is nonzero. 
## Methods
1. Determinant
	If the [[Determinant]] of the set of vectors is nonzero, $det(V)\neq 0$, then they are linearly independent.
2. Analysis
