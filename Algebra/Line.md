## Definition
An infinitely long object with no width, depth or curvature. The two [[Dimension]]al form is usually written as: $$y=kx+m$$However when describing it in more than two dimensions a parametric [[Equation]] is usually used instead as a line cannot be described with a singular equation anymore: $$\begin{align}x=x_{0}+at \\ y=y_{0}+bt \\ z=z_{0}+ct\end{align}$$Where the [[Point]], $p_{0}=(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$, is any point on the line, $t$ is a [[Scalar]] in $t\in\mathbb{R}$ and $v=(a,b,c)$ is the directional [[Vector]] of the line.
