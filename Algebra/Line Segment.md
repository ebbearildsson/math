## Definition
A segment of a [[Line]]. Usually defined as either two [[Point]]s, $p_{1}= (x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $p_{2}=(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$, where the line segment exists between them or as a point and a [[Vector]], $p=(x,y,z)$ and $v=(a,b,c)$, where the vector points from the first point to another.
