## Definition
An [[Intersection]] between two [[Line]]s occurs when they share a [[Point]] where they are equal.
## Methods
1. Equality
Take the lines $y_1=2x+3$ and $y_2=5x+6$. Then set up the equation: $$y_1=y_2\rightarrow 2x+3=5x+6 \rightarrow 3x=-3 \rightarrow x=-1$$
Then putting in the aquired x-value into one of the lines equations gives the y-value:
$$y_1=2\cdot-1+3=1$$
Thus the intersection occurs at $(-1,1)$.
